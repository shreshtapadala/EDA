EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

EDA refers to the method of studying and exploring data to observe their predominant traits, discover patterns, locate outliers, and identify relationships between variables.

EDA is normally carried out as a preliminary step before undertaking formal statistical analyses or modeling.

The Objective of this notebook is to give an idea on how to perform EDA on a dataset before modelling.

Purpose of EDA:

=> To analyze the features.

=> Finding relationships or trends between features.

About the DataSet:

The sinking of the Titanic is onr of the most infamous shipwreks in history. The Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This is a titanic dataset and we study and explore the features related to the survival of the passengers.

=> Getting Insights About The Dataset

=> Handling Missing Values

=> Data visualization
